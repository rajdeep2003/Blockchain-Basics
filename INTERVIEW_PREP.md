# Interview Prep: Confidently Explaining Your Project

This guide provides structured answers to common interview questions about this project. It's written from your perspective ("I," "my") to help you articulate your experience clearly and confidently.

### **Question 1: "Can you give me an overview of this project? What problem does it solve?"**

**Your Answer:**

"Certainly. I built a full-stack decentralized application called 'Krypt' that functions as a peer-to-peer crypto-sending service. At its core, the project solves the problem of needing a trusted third party, like a bank or a service like Venmo, to conduct simple financial transactions."

"Instead of relying on a private, centralized database, my application uses a custom smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain as its backend. This makes the transaction ledger completely transparent, permanent, and not controlled by any single entity. The real-world use case it simulates is a global remittance or P2P payment platform where users are always in full control of their own funds through their personal crypto wallet, like MetaMask."

### **Question 2: "What was the tech stack you used to build this?"**

**Your Answer:**

"I used a modern, full-stack Web3 tech stack. I broke it down into three main layers:"

*   "**For the Blockchain Backend**, I wrote the smart contract in **Solidity**. I used **Hardhat** as my development environment. Hardhat was essential for compiling and testing the contract, and for running a local blockchain node for development."

*   "**For the Frontend**, I built the user interface with **React**. I used **Vite** as my build tool for a fast and modern development experience, and I used **Tailwind CSS** for the styling to build a clean, responsive UI quickly."

*   "**For the Connection Layer**, the bridge between the frontend and the blockchain, I used the **Ethers.js** library. And for the user-side wallet and interaction with the dApp, the project is designed to work with **MetaMask**."

### **Question 3: "Could you explain how the blockchain part of your project works?"**

**Your Answer:**

"Of course. The core of the backend is a Solidity smart contract I wrote called `Transactions.sol`. Its main responsibility is to act as a public and permanent on-chain ledger for all the transfers made through the application."

"The contract has a few key components:
1.  A `struct` I defined, `TransferStruct`, which is a custom data type to hold the details of each transaction: the sender's address, the receiver's address, the amount, a timestamp, and a message.
2.  An `array` of these structs, `transactions[]`, which stores every transaction ever recorded.
3.  The main function, `addToBlockchain()`. This is a state-changing function that anyone can call. When called, it takes the transaction details, bundles them into a new `TransferStruct`, and pushes it into the public `transactions` array. This is what creates the permanent record.
4.  A `view` function, `getAllTransactions()`, which is a read-only function. It doesn't cost any gas to call and simply returns the entire array of stored transactions for the frontend to display."

"So, in short, the smart contract doesn't hold the users' funds; it's a decentralized and immutable logbook that's open for anyone to read from but can only be written to by following the rules I defined in the code."

### **Question 4: "How does your React frontend interact with the smart contract?"**

**Your Answer:**

"The interaction between the frontend and the blockchain is one of the most critical parts of the project, and it's primarily managed by the **Ethers.js library**."

"The process works like this:
1.  First, the frontend needs two pieces of information: the smart contract's **on-chain address** and its **ABI** (Application Binary Interface). The ABI is a JSON file, generated by the Hardhat compiler, that essentially tells my JavaScript code what functions the smart contract has and how to call them.
2.  In my React code, I used the Context API to manage the blockchain state globally. Within this `TransactionContext`, I create a JavaScript instance of the smart contract using this line: `new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer)`.
3.  The `signer` here is the key. Ethers.js gets the signer object from the user's connected MetaMask wallet. This object represents the user's account and gives my application the ability to *propose* transactions that the user can then *approve* or *sign*.
4.  With this `contract` object created, I can now call my smart contract's functions as if they were just JavaScript methods. For example:
    *   `contract.getAllTransactions()` makes a read-only call to the blockchain to fetch data.
    *   `contract.addToBlockchain(...)` creates a write transaction. Ethers.js formats this call correctly, and MetaMask then prompts the user to sign and pay the gas fee to execute it on the blockchain."

### **Question 5: "What were your biggest takeaways or what did you learn from building this?"**

**Your Answer:**

"This project was a fantastic learning experience that solidified both technical skills and conceptual understanding of Web3."

"1.  **Technically**, I gained practical, hands-on experience with the entire dApp development lifecycle. I went from writing a smart contract in Solidity to deploying it and building a full-featured React frontend to interact with it. I'm now very comfortable with the workflow of using Hardhat for backend development and Ethers.js as the bridge to the frontend.

2.  **Conceptually**, I developed a much deeper understanding of the **asynchronous nature of blockchain**. A key challenge was managing the application's state. When a user sends a transaction, it's not instant. I learned how to implement a proper UX flow with loading states to give the user feedback while their transaction is being mined, and then update the UI only after receiving confirmation from the blockchain.

3.  **From a UX perspective**, I learned about the unique challenges of building for Web3. It forced me to think about how to onboard users in a world where they need to connect a wallet, understand gas fees, and approve transactions. It's a different paradigm than traditional web apps, and building this project gave me insight into creating a more intuitive user journey."
